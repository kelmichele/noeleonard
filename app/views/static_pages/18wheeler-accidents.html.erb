				<h4>18 Wheeler Accidents</h4>
				<p>Any vehicle on the road can be deadly if it is defective or driven negligently. Due to their size and strength, however, 18 wheelers are in a class all their own. Accidents involving 18 wheelers commonly lead to serious injury or death. When drivers operate 18 wheelers negligently, they should be held accountable.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="b2">
				<h4>Accident Factors</h4>
				<p> Driver negligence is often a major factor in these accidents, but it is not the sole reason they occur. Defective and faulty equipment, as well as hazardous materials and cargo on the actual trucks, have also been known to cause these accidents.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="b3 right">
				<p class="bold">These factors lead to one simple truth:<br> <span>18 wheeler litigation can grow in complexity quickly.</span></p>
				<p>That is why it is essential for 18 wheeler victims in Alabama to receive legal assistance with their accident. This requires an attorney who is familiar with both state and federal law.</p>
