Foley Alabama Truck Accident Attorney
While all vehicles on Alabama roads can be deadly if they are defective or driven negligently, 18 wheelers are in a class all their own.
If an ordinary car is analogous to the danger of a bullet, then an 18 wheeler is a missile.

These large, hulking behemoths are unwieldy vehicles that can — and do — wreak inordinate amounts of havoc on Alabama roads. For this reason, accidents involving large 18 wheelers often lead to serious injury and death.
When drivers operate these vehicles negligently, they need to be held accountable. And, while driver negligence is often a major factor in 18 wheeler accidents, negligence is not the sole reason for 18 wheeler accidents.
Defective and faulty equipment can also be the reason for a devastating 18 wheeler accident. In other cases, hazardous materials and cargo on the truck itself can be the cause of the issue.
These factors lead to one simple truth: 18 wheeler litigation can grow in complexity quickly. That is why it is essential for Alabama 18 wheeler victims to receive legal assistance for their Alabama accident.
This requires an attorney who is familiar with both state and federal law. Alabama trucking companies are required to comply with federal safety regulations that are meant to enhance the safety of Alabama roads and the citizens who drive on them.
If any of these federal regulations are violated, you may be entitled to file a lawsuit against the trucking company even if the driver did not behave negligently. Noel B. Leonard has the experience necessary to determine whether such a violation occurred.
