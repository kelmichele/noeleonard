	<h3>Motorcycle Accident Claims &amp; Serious Injuries</h3>
	<div class="b1">
		<p>Motorcycles are the least protected vehicles on the road, which unfortunately leads to higher injury and death rates than those of traditional motorists. Motorcycle accidents typically result in high medical costs, and demand a successful litigation outcome in order to pay for medical expenses.</p>

	<div class="b2">

In the turbulent aftermath of a devastating motorcycle accident, you need an attorney you can trust to fight for you.</p>
