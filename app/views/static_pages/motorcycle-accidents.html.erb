				<h4>Accident Attorney, Noel B. Leonard understands firsthand how important motorcycle safety is.</h4>
				<p>Motorcycles are the least protected vehicles on the road. Unfortunately, this leads to a higher average of injury and death rates than those of traditional motorists.
				Motorcycle accidents typically result in high medical expenses, that often times, can only be paid after a successful litigation outcome.</p>
				<p>If you or a loved one has been in a motorcycle accident, you need an attorney who understands your pain, and has the ability to deliver the legal results to help you recover.</p>

		<p>We counsel all motorcyclists to wear a helmet and follow essential safety precautions on the road, as there are many dangerous and negligent drivers out there.</p>
		<p>In the event that you are in an accident caused by a negligent driver, it is essential that you have as much protection as possible, to prevent life-threatening injuries.</p>
		<p>While a helmet is no guarantee that a life will be saved, in many cases a helmet has been the difference between life and death.</p>
